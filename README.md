#### About
I'm currently a UVic student on my final semester of a computer science undergrad. I work mostly in the JVM ecosystem on the serverside, using rust when I can get away with it. I'll also write, code wise, wonderful typescript+React; however, I'd recommend not letting me do UI design.

##### Things I like
- Functional Programming
- APIs with specs (openapi, gRPC, graphql)
- Postgres
- Property testing and fuzzing


##### Things that suck
- ORM's
- dynamic types
